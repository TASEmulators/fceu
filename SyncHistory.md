## Introduction ##
[.fcm](http://code.google.com/p/fceu/wiki/FCM) files made with older versions of FCEU may desync on FCEU.28.  This page describes a brief history of older FCEU rerecording versions and sync differences.  All older versions are available in the [downloads section](http://code.google.com/p/fceu/downloads/list).


---

### FCEU.12 ###
This was the first widely used FCEU rerecording branch.  TAS features were implemented by Blip.  Nearly all NES [TAS](http://TASvideos.org) movies made in 2004-2005 were made with this version.

Note: If capturing AVI's of these older movies, use the [AVI capture fix](http://fceu.googlecode.com/files/fceu-0.98.12-avifix.src.zip) version of .12

### FCEU.13 ###
Many new features added by Nitsuja.  However, some sync differences were introduced.  Some movies (such as Dragon Warrior 4) made with .12 no longer synced

### FCEU.15 ###
More new features/enhancements/bug fixes added by Nitsuja.  There maybe some sync differences between .13 and .15.  Few movies were made with .13 since the .15 release was so soon after.

### FCEU.16 ###
New TAS tools added by luke including basicbot & memory watch.  However, it introduced sync differences compared to .15

This was the primary version used for many movies in 2005 & 2006.

### FCEU.17-FCEU.28 ###
All versions of FCEU (.17-.28) should have the same sync.
FCEU.28 is the last version made as the project was abandoned in favor of [FCEUX](http://fceux.com)
