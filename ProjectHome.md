**FCE Ultra** is an Open Source Nintendo Entertainment System emulator that also supports emulation of the Famicom Disk System and network play via TCP/IP. It is a fork of Bero's FCE, and has become far more advanced than its predecessor.

FCEU v0.98.28 is the rerecording version of FCEUltra with many customized features designed to aid in recording [Tool Assisted Movies](http://tasvideos.org).

The FCEU Rerecording project is an attempt fix bugs in post FCEU.25 updates and finish up some of the remaining feature enhancements.

### Documentation ###
FCEU.28 uses .fcm movie files: [.fcm movie file specification](http://code.google.com/p/fceu/wiki/FCM).

Having desync problems?  Perhaps the .fcm was made with an older version: [FCEU rerecording version history](http://code.google.com/p/fceu/wiki/SyncHistory).

Previous versions of FCEU rerecording (including src) are available in the downloads section: [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/fceu/downloads/list).
